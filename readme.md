# PhotonVision Pi Image Release Repo

This repo demonstrates how to update the PhotonVision pi .img with a specific version of photonvision, and additional custom files as needed.

# Getting Started

[The basic instructions for PhotonVision installation apply](https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/getting-started/installation/coprocessor-image.html#raspberry-pi-installation). However, rather than using the linked .zip/.img files, use the release from this repo instead.
